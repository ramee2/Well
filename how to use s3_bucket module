put below content on main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module s3_bucket {
  source = "github.com/ramee2/Well/s3buket"
  bucket_prefix = "this-is-only-a-test-bucket-delete-assignment"
  target_bucket = "this-is-the-target-bucket-assignment"
}


2. fetch the module from repo/registery
    terraform get
